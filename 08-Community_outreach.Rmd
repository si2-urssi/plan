# Community and Outreach

Researchers in academia and national labs are incentivized to become experts in one or more specialized domains. While research software plays a critical role in achieving such mastery, skills to develop such software are rarely taught in formal settings. These skills are often picked up from secondary special interest communities and online resources. We plan to formalize such community resources and associated activities in our institute plans. 

The institute's Community area will build a thriving community of like-minded peers for researchers to seek advice, learn about training opportunities and funding announcements. A community manager will curate state of the art information on best practices for research software development. The Community area will also administer a competitive fellowship program for early career researchers. These fellowships will provide funding, training, and prestige to pursue a career that promotes the development and use of research software. The thriving community will also provide venues and annual conference focused on software across disciplines where researchers can share their work, learn about new software, and software development techniques. 

Many of the current challenges around sustainability of software, and those who produce it, are mostly social and cultural and not limited by any unassailable technical challenges. While other areas of the institute such as Policy and Education & Training lay down the guidelines and training necessary to grow the research software enterprise, a strong community strategy will be key to maintaining it. URSSI will act as the hub for all types of researchers interested in using and developing research software. The institute will  provide necessary resources to address shared challenges and help catalyze collaborations to tackle emerging problems. URSSI's Community & Outreach area will achieve this mission through the set of activities described below.

## ii. Resources

Managing communications (website with regular posts, mailing list), producing high quality newsletters and acting as a community liaison will require 2-3 FTEs. This could involve a Director of Community (could be part of a PI's time), with the remaining part of the area's workforce split over two positions: a community manager and fellowship coordinator (split with the Incubator Area), reporting to the Director of Community. Besides the budget for the 2-3 positions, the Community & Outreach area of the institute will also require budget for:

-  Technical infrastructure (including: website, mailing list, archiving of resources) 

- One URSSI fellow (as part of a cohort of 4-5 fellows/year)

-  Participant support for fellows to attend annual meetings

-  Base costs for an annual URSSI conference (with the rest to be supported by registration and sponsorships)


## iii. Methods


### **In-person events**

Create new community events: Building upon the work of small workshops such as WSSSPE, there is an opportunity for URSSI to host an annual in-person conference for scientists, developers, and students to connect and discuss research software development and their applications. The conference will initially be small (with a limit of 300 participants) and grow depending on the interest. Talks and workshops will span the entire continuum from applied computational research to software development. The event will also feature a “demo day” for URSSI incubated projects. The costs for such an event will be supplemented by a mix of registration fees and sponsorships.


### **Online community events**

Promote existing activities: One of URSSI's strengths will lie in amplifying the work of existing initiatives. We will achieve this by showcasing projects in our weekly newsletter, by inviting projects to present their work on monthly community calls (aka webinars), and by highlighting/crossposting news via partner organizations such as the Carpentries, rOpenSci, Workshop on Sustainable Software for Science (WSSSPE), Mozilla, and others.

Community calls: Modeled after the successful series organized by Mozilla and rOpenSci, a monthly webinar series will expose researchers to the latest best practices and new trends in research software, and will provide them an opportunity to interact with prominent research software engineers. This free and open series will provide additional opportunity for the community to participate, especially for those that are constrained by travel. Past calls, including videos, code, and Q&A will be archived and made searchable by a dedicated community coordinator.

**Curating and disseminating best practices**

URSSI fellows will convene ad hoc panels of experts to curate information on state of the art practices for scientific computing. The topics will cover many foundations of research software engineering including but not limited to collaborative software developing with modern version control, software testing, code review, packaging and distribution, and overall software design. The materials will also provide strong guidance on open science practices to increase impact of such work. These include guidance on licensing, properly archiving research software, and citation.


### **Newsletter and social media**

There is a huge opportunity for URSSI to produce and disseminate a high quality newsletter to keep the community informed about research software news, notable research papers, critical software, events and job openings. The data science community already benefits from such [a newsletter](https://cds.nyu.edu/newsletter/) that is maintained by Laura Noren and Brad Stegner and financially supported by the Academic Data Science Alliance. The community manager will curate news, jobs, software releases, conferences, and activities of other organizations (by crossposting).  For community calls, we will invite speakers from related communities such as SSI, BSSw, US-RSE, and also solicit presentations from the larger community. All material will be stored in public GitHub repositories under a permissive license to allow people to use and remix the content while contributing back to the original source.

The four major channels of communication will be a website, a newsletter, mailing list, and accounts on social media such as Twitter and Slack.


### Other activities  
Besides the activities described above, the institute will feature these ongoing activities:



*   URSSI will serve as a broker for software expertise and connect developers to scientific projects [TODO: Flesh out details of this program]
*   Promote training events from URSSI and other communities
*   Develop an ambassador program for early career researchers to promote sustainable software and current issues to their local communities. [TODO: Flesh out details of this program]
*   Hosting a blog, with a series of staff and guest blog posts, including cross-posting relevant blog posts from others


## iv. Metrics of success

**Goals: **



*   Steadily grow the number of subscribers and participants each year
*   Grow the diversity of participants, instructors, and speakers each year. Self reported data on affiliations and domains of expertise will also provide a measurable metric of impact across domains.
*   Grow the number of applications we receive for the fellowship program every year
*   Grow the rate of paper and poster submissions every year
*   Improve the careers of those who participate in URSSI

**Metrics:**



*   Number of subscribers to the newsletter, visitors to the website, and social media followers over time
*   Number of subscribers to the newsletter, visitors to the website, and social media followers over time
*   Quantify instructors, presenters, lesson developers, and participants by demographic and geographic breakdown
*   
*   Count citations of software that have participated in URSSI
*   Tracking career paths of fellows will also act as a measure of success for the program
