<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.2.1</span> Develop and annually run a summer school on practices for sustainable software development for research software</h3>
<p><em>Overview</em>: During the conceptualization phase, we identified a need for additional,
focused training opportunities on sustainable software development practices for researchers
who were not in a domain covered by an existing institute. One of the primary reasons for
this need is that it is generally difficult for degree programs to make room for this type of
content. We plan to meet this need with a summer school, which is a proven method for
providing hands-on training to transfer these skills to students, in this case on sustainable
software development practices for research software development. We conducted a Pilot
Winter School as part of the conceptualization process. The details of that activity appear
in <a href="chapter2-WinterSchool.html#chapter2-WinterSchool">Chapter 2</a>. The plan described here builds on the key lessons
learned, including: (1) the school needs to be longer to allow for both discussion time
and focused time for students to work on their own code, applying the lessons from the
lectures, and (2) the presence of additional helpers outside of the primary instructors
was quite beneficial to help answer specific questions from the students.</p>
<p><em>Content</em>: Based on the needs identified during our survey, workshops, and other discussions,
we identified the following topics as candidates for inclusion in such a school:
(1) software design (including modularity), (2) software testing,
(3) packaging and distributing code,
(4) collaborative software development with modern version control (i.e., git/GitHub),
(5) peer code review, (6) open science principles, and (7) software citation.</p>
<p><em>Format</em>: The summer school will be a 1-week in-person event. We plan to follow the
successful PNAS hackweek model <span class="citation">(Huppenkothen et al. <a href="#ref-Huppenkothen8872" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span> where we allocate 50% of the time
to lectures and 50% of the time to putting the concepts into practice. We will
invite instructors with expertise in the different topic areas (see above) to participate
and deliver the lectures, and will take diversity into consideration when selecting instructors.
One of the criteria used to select participants will be a diversity statement that potential participants
will be required to submit, and at least 25% of the selected participants will be members of underrepresented groups.
To facilitate the “hacking” time,
we will ask participants to bring a code project they wish to work on during the
school. The “hacking sessions” will provide ample opportunities for the participants to
have hands-on time applying the concepts from the lectures to their own code projects. These sessions
also provide time for code reviews and other ad hoc topics that arise during the school.
The instructors will be available during the hands-on time to help participants as
needed. By the end of the school, participants should have substantial intellectual
knowledge and experiential knowledge. Because researchers often do not have sufficient
time for training or to attend events like this one, as an alternative to the face-to-face
summer school events, we also plan to package the content into Carpentries-style lessons
that can be used either in shorter training sessions, webinars, or asynchronously.</p>
<p>The URSSI summer school is primarily aimed at the people and careers portion of URSSI’s impact goals, and secondarily at the research software sustainability and research software ecosystem portions.</p>

<p><em>Overview</em>: One challenge faced by many research software developers is how to convert
a small (individual) coding effort into a more formal project. This situation occurs
frequently as researchers develop small units of code to accomplish tasks important in
their own work. When other researchers are exposed to these code units, they often want
either to use the code, add to the code, or both. This is the point when the researcher
needs to convert that code into a more formal project, both to ensure quality as others
use it and to allow the community to contribute to it. Therefore, we propose to develop
a Research Project Carpentry lesson plan, along similar lines as Software Carpentry, that
will help researchers make this transition from an individual coding effort to a
community-focused project.</p>
<p><em>Content</em>: The goal of this effort will be to help projects develop a good project plan.
As such, the Research Project Carpentries lesson program will focus on helping researchers
understand what content a good plan needs to contain. It will also provide information
researchers need for making choices about which of the various practices are most relevant
to their particular project. The topics to be covered in Research Project Carpentry include:
(1) requirements elicitation, (2) issue tracking, (3) source and version control, (4) testing,
(5) documentation, (6) packaging and distribution, (7) pair programming, (8) code review, and
(9) metrics. Note that there is some overlap between the focus of Research Project Carpentry
and the Summer School described above. We anticipate reusing relevant content between these efforts.</p>
<p><em>Format</em>: We will develop modules on the topics above as carpentries-style modules. This approach
will allow the Research Projects Carpentries materials to be used either in a face-to-face training
course, like the Summer School, or as stand-alone units. This flexibility will allow researchers
to access the content in a mechanism that is most relevant to them. When this material is tested,
we will use use a diversity statement submitted by potential participants as an input to the decision
process, and at least 25% of the selected participants will be members of underrepresented groups.</p>
<p><em>Note</em>: While this activity is relevant to the URSSI effort, we believe that it will have appeal
beyond URSSI. Therefore, even though we include it here in the plan, we will also seek funding to
support it from organizations outside of NSF. We also plan to solicit other organizations and
individuals to contribute to this activity. URSSI will lead this work, organizing a community
that will include external participants.</p>
<p>The Research Project Carpentry lesson program is primarily aimed at the research software sustainability portion of URSSI’s impact goals, and secondarily at the research software ecosystem portion.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.2.3</span> Plan a review service for software project plans</h3>
<p>Building on the work done for Research Project Carpentries, URSSI has identified the need for
a service where experts review and comment on proposed project plans. Researchers who are
interested in this service would submit a project plan in a specified format. Then, experts
would review the plan to ensure both that it is (1) complete with respect to the content necessary
for the type of project and its current stage, as well as (2) the choices made for each aspect of
the project plan are consistent with best practices. Once the review is completed, the reviewer
would work with the project team to help resolve any deficiencies identified in the original
project plan. This model is akin to that used by many “incubators” for start-up companies.</p>
<p>This activity is likely beyond the scope of URSSI, so we will create an initial plan for it,
then seek to partner with other organizations who are pursuing similar efforts and explore
external funding sources. In addition to the operating the service, URSSI and partners will need
to develop and make available the following resources: (1) templates for project plans,
(2) checklists for researchers to follow when developing the plan, and (3) guidance on how
to choose from various alternatives for each section of the plan.</p>
<p>The softare project plan review service is aimed at the research software sustainability portion of URSSI’s impact goals.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.2.4</span> Evaluate and document successes and failures of the use of industrial software development practices in research software</h3>
<p>Industrial software engineering has developed and refined a number of best practices for
software engineering and software development, resulting in a large body of related literature.
Conversely, it is not always clear which of these practices are relevant for use in developing
research software, most notably because of the different incentive structures for developers
in the research arena. It is also not always clear which aspects
of the research software domain motivate the need to develop new software engineering or
software development practices to handle the unique contexts within which research software
exists. To accomplish this activity, URSSI will need to perform the following steps.</p>
<p>First, URSSI will gather experience reports describing the successful and unsuccessful use
of industrial software engineering and software development practices in research software
projects. Gathering these experiences will involve conducting surveys and interviews of
developers of research software to document important information. In addition to the
successes and failures with specific practices, these experience reports will also document
cases where developers of research software encountered a situation or a problem for which
they were unable to find software engineering or software development practices that were
relevant. Cases where there is a lack of relevant practices suggest opportunities for
creation of new practices.</p>
<p>Second, URSSI will analyze the experience reports to systematize the successes and failures
and develop a series of evidence-based lessons learned. Because this information will be
based upon real experiences from research projects, they will have great value to other
research software projects.</p>
<p>The results of these efforts will feed into the next activity by providing concrete experiences
that we can document into best practices. These experiences will be beneficial because we
will draw them from experiences on real projects, with knowledge about the context within
which the practice works. This context will help provide a description of the limitations
on the practice, which is equally important to document.</p>
<p>This activity is primarily aimed at the research software sustainability portion of URSSI’s impact goals, and secondarily at the research software ecosystem portion.</p>

<div id="compile-and-maintain-a-body-of-knowledge-of-best-practices-for-research-software-development" class="section level3" number="5.2.5">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.2.5</span> Compile and maintain a body of knowledge of best practices for research software development</h3>
<p>Based on the outcomes of the above activities, URSSI will develop a portal to provide living
information about best practices for research software development. In addition to including
content developed from our own activities, URSSI will also actively find, through various
means that include workshops and surveys, and curate information from other sites related
to the development of research or scientific software. We will specifically ensure that
information produced by the Carpentries is included, as relevant.</p>
<p>We will curate the following types of information:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Checklists for sustainable software - much of the content here will overlap with
ideas discussed in earlier activities.</p></li>
<li><p>Templates for use in developing software, including templates for project plans,
templates for documenting requirements, templates for test planning, and templates
for community guidelines and policies.</p></li>
<li><p>Badging efforts that provide recognition for various qualities of research software
and research software projects.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In addition to best practices, the URSSI clearinghouse will also curate information
about training resources. In addition to providing links to the URSSI-developed training
(described above), we will also link to other relevant training resources developed
through other efforts like MoLSSI, SGCI, and IRIS-HEP. To help individual researchers
and teams better understand how to make use of the various training options, we will
develop roadmaps that guide people to the most relevant training for their current situation.</p>
<p>This activity is also primarily aimed at the research software sustainability portion of URSSI’s impact goals, and secondarily at the research software ecosystem portion.</p>
