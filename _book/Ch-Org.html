<h1><span class="header-section-number">Chapter 8</span> Management &amp; Coordination Area</h1>
<p>The Management &amp; Coordination Area of URSSI is designed to manage the project (assign and monitor work,
usually in work packages; monitor, mitigate, and respond to risks; provide reports; adapt work to
community feedback; and ensure project sustainability) and foster collaboration between the four
other areas of URSSI: Policy, Education &amp; Training, Incubator, and Outreach &amp; Community.</p>
<div id="management-resources" class="section level2" number="8.1">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">8.1</span> Management resources</h2>
<p>The PI and Co-PIs are funded at 0.25 FTE and are supported by staff at their home institutions for
writing reports and budgeting, etc. The Work Package Leader roles are filled by PIs and/or senior
personnel and are funded at around 0.1 FTE for leading a work package. The Sustainability Officer,
Diversity Officer and Evaluator are each planned at 0.1 - 0.25 FTE depending on the phase of the
institute. The initial phases of ramping up the institute, defining work packages (see definition below)
and services, as well as detailed project plans with 1-year to 5-year goals will require more effort
at the beginning, and we will revisit the level of effort after about 18 months and 48 months.
In addition to continuous monitoring of progress and risks and potential refactoring of work and
addressing risks, work on sustainability, evaluation and diversity, will be major topics.</p>
</div>
<div id="work-packages" class="section level2" number="8.2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">8.2</span> Work packages</h2>
<p>All work to be done in URSSI (including management and coordination) is structured into
work packages (WPs), which are organized around the project’s goals and areas, with an additional
WP that is concerned with quality and risk management, project coordination, sustainability, and
reporting activities. A WP defines a discrete unit of work over some period, and can be part of
one or more areas. The duration of a WP can be a fixed period (e.g., six months to organize and
run a single training event) or can span the full lifetime of the project, such would be the case
for the maintenance of the website or regular distribution of newsletters. For example, a WP to
support a new open-source project might last a year and span three areas: education &amp; training,
incubator, and outreach &amp; community.</p>
<center>
<img src="images/WPs-v3.jpg" title="fig:" alt="FigName" />
</center>
<p>Fig. Areas and WPs: A WP can exist in one or more areas. The WP “Project coordination, risk management
and reporting” spans all four areas and lasts for the duration of the project. WPx, for example, is
part of Education &amp; Training, Incubator, and Outreach &amp; Community. WPy, WPz, and WPw each exist in
a single area.</p>

<p>Management of URSSI includes activities that occur at different levels, appropriate to the size and
structure of the institute. This section presents the project’s organizational and decision-making
mechanisms, as well as its process for ensuring effective information interchange between the
individual work packages. Central to the project’s management is a key set of roles and committees,
which are described in detail below: the PI, the Co-PIs, the Work Package Leaders, a sustainability
officer, an evaluator, and the Steering Committee. Work Package leaders may be Co-PIs or other URSSI staff.</p>
<p>The <strong>PI and Co-PIs</strong> have overall responsibility for project activities and will work with the
evaluator to make periodic revisions to ensure the project’s continuing success.The PI will manage
the administrative and financial aspects of the project, with the assistance of one or two staff
members. The PI will also oversee the day-to-day management of the project, with the support of the
Co-PIs. The PI and Co-PIs are responsible for reviewing the overall progress of the project. They will
work closely with the Work Package Leaders to manage the technical work of the project.
<strong>Work Package Leaders</strong> will be responsible for the progress of their individual work packages, the
timely production and quality of deliverables, and the achievement of milestones.
The <strong>Sustainability Officer</strong> will work towards ensuring the sustainability of the overall institute.
The <strong>Diversity Officer</strong> will ensure that URSSI meets its internal and external diversity goals, and will
suggest additional activities as needed.
The <strong>Evaluator</strong> will ensure that URSSI activities progress towards the overall goals of URSSI are measured and,
and will suggest corrective actions when needed.
The <strong>Steering Committee</strong> will advise and support the PI and Co-PIs. <strong>Senior Personnel</strong> are
responsible for tasks assigned to them by Work Package leaders. Tasks include administrative tasks for the project.</p>
<p>This structure has been developed to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ensure effective management of the project;</li>
<li>Ensure clearly defined communication channels both internal and external to the project;</li>
<li>Establish clear procedures for making decisions and resolving conflicts;</li>
<li>Ensure the project proceeds within the framework of the budget, including efficient reallocation of budget if necessary and according to administrative, financial, and legal principles defined by NSF; and</li>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">8.4.5</span> Sustainability Officer</h3>
<p>The sustainability officer ensures that all actions and work packages are analyzed regarding their
contribution to the sustainability of the institute. Work packages might be effective at the beginning
of the institute but might phase out over time or need to be redefined with different metrics, for
example. The sustainability officer can suggest and lead work packages such as building additional
collaborations and analyzing and/or applying for additional funding streams. They would collaborate
closely with the incubator area to use its methods for spinning out work packages to be self-sustainable
beyond the duration and funding of the project. The sustainability officer is planned as part of the
advisory board, not as a Co-PI, so they are not involved in day-to-day management of an area or work packages.
The goal is that this role maintains and provides a high-level external perspective on impact and measures for sustainability.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">8.5</span> Risk management</h2>
<p>The leadership team as well as the steering committee are well experienced in project and risk management.
The leadership team will maintain a risk register that is refreshed at least annually, and will address
risks that may impair progress towards the project’s objectives by proposing strategies to address those
risks and directing the project according to the work plan, taking corrective actions as needed. The
project plan will be designed to accommodate appropriate and proven risk management practices.</p>
<p>Some risks common to any type of project of this size and complexity, including coordination risks,
problems in tasks delivering, loss of a project team member and a low impact on community building and
community growth. Other risks are specific to this institute plan, such as little interaction between
existing institutes for complementing each other’s activities.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">8.7</span> SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats)</h2>
<p>A SWOT analysis helps find the best match between environmental trends (opportunities and threats) and internal capabilities.</p>
<ul>
<li>A strength is a resource or capacity the organization can use effectively to achieve its objectives.</li>
<li>A weakness is a limitation, fault, or defect in the organization that will keep it from achieving its objectives.</li>
<li>An opportunity is any favorable situation in the organization’s environment. It is usually a trend or change of some kind or an overlooked need that increases demand for a product or service and permits the firm to enhance its position by supplying it.</li>
<li>A threat is any unfavorable situation in the organization’s environment that is potentially damaging to its strategy. The threat may be a barrier, a constraint, or anything external that might cause problems, damage or injury.</li>
</ul>
<p>The SWOT analysis is based on experiences in the conceptualization phase of URSSI.</p>
<p>Strengths</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Conceptualization of URSSI created already awareness and some community involvement</p></li>
<li><p>Experience with winter school</p></li>
<li><p>Results of survey and ethnographic studies</p></li>
