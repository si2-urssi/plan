</h1>
<p>The Policy area’s intent is create an enabling environment to support the people who develop and maintain research software, and to
support research about research software, to ultimately increase the science &amp; research impact of
software.<br><strong>The Policy area’s activities are divided into two parts, research and advocacy</strong>. Research is the collecting
and analyzing of data, while advocacy is the dissemination of the research results in such a way that it
changes practices.
The Policy area focuses on understanding and then advocating for potential initiatives (actions, mandates, incentives, directives)
that decision makers can take, sometimes thought of as leverage points,
including strategies and decisions to invest. Policy happens at multiple levels, including national,
funding agency, institution, and research group.</p>
<p>The Changes that the Policy area seeks to make include:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>In funding agencies, direct funding of software maintenance and other software sustainability activities
is a core part of the mission, e.g., at NSF, this includes all program officers across all directorates.</p></li>
<li><p>In universities and academic fields, positions for people developing and maintaining research software
are available, recognized, and rewarded.</p></li>
<li><p>In publishing, support and recognition for software as a core part of scholarly research is the norm.
(This includes the recognition that software is as valuable to the research community as the results themselves,
that processes exist to evaluate software in papers, expectations for authorship for software developers are clear.)</p></li>
<li><p>In industry, sharing best practices, coordinating efforts, and contributing to open source software
projects is the norm.</p></li>
<li><p>Open source software is recognized as a key element of open science and reproducibility.</p></li>
<li><p>Research software is built and maintained by a diverse and inclusive group.</p></li>

<p>The policy area comprises:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Director for Policy, an URSSI co-PI, leads the overall Policy area, working with the
Policy Advisory Board and Policy staff to define and execute policy research and advocacy activities.</p></li>
<li><p>Policy Data Science Team: performs research such as finding, collecting, and analyzing data,
aimed at informing policy, but not about policy
itself. For example, with regard to software usage metrics, empirical studies would be most effective,
but this team would not recommend policy language based on those studies.
Includes a possible assistant director, funded staff, URSSI fellows, and community volunteers.</p></li>
<li><p>Policy Advocacy Team, focused on policy development (such as use cases and examples of practices
that are effective for sustainability), which ultimately would be used for presenting actionable ways
to support research software to institutions, possibly integrating and building upon the data science
teams findings. This team focuses more on planning advocacy that in doing it,
by understanding different stakeholders, and building a roadmap for how to effectively advocate
(within universities, foundations, industry, national labs, etc.)
Includes a possible assistant director, funded staff, URSSI fellows, and community volunteers.</p></li>
<li><p>Policy advisory board (appointed volunteers) who provide advice on potential policy area
research questions and advocacy activities.</p></li>

<p><strong>Funding for personnel</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>3 FTEs, divided across possibly part-time Assistant Directors for Policy Data Science and Policy Advocacy,
the Policy Data Science Team (potentially a postdoc), and the Policy Advocacy Team.
The Director for Policy might also act as one of the Assistant Directors, depending on that person’s background.</li>

<p>Initial activities are planned around an initial set of aims articulated below, where additional
aims also will be suggested. The URSSI leadership group will regularly review suggestions
of new aims, and will determine a rough desired level of activity across the aims.</p>
<p>The policy team will then develop and scope activities to match these desired levels, with review
from the Policy Advisory Board, which will also be able to suggest adding or removing aims
back to the leadership group.</p>
<p>The policy team will also maintain this listing of active, planned, and potential activities and
its mapping to the aim. Activities will be split into those that, if successful, are likely
to lead to significant changes in 1-2 years, 3-5 years, and longer-term, with an initial goal of
applying 50% of resources to the 1-2 year activities, 40% to the 3-5 year activities, and 10% to
the longer-term activities.</p>

<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">7.2.3</span> Planned Activity Pool<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#planned-activity-pool"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>This is the initial list of activities that URSSI will maintain, and choose from. The specific
activities that will be chosen to start depend on the funding level for URSSI. Most activities
include an amount of effort (generally in person-months) that is needed to accomplish them.
Note that some activities (the items below) include
raising additional funds for those activities - that fund raising is part of the activity. Other
activities (in the “Unplanned Activity Pool” subsection) are tracked but are beyond the scope of URSSI, and are more
likely activities that others might perform, potentially in coordination with URSSI.</p>
<p>Activities are divided into two types:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><strong>Policy Research Activities</strong>. These activities involve research, such as gathering and analyzing evidence and data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Policy Advocacy Activities</strong>. These activities focus on advocacy. They generally depend on policy research or previously
gathered evidence and data.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>High-level activities include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Maintaining the list of potential activities and prioritizing them, including getting inputs
from the overall community. These inputs will be collected and recorded by all members of the
project in their interactions with the community, as well as by community members, via tagged
GitHub issues. Community members will be able to see this list and react with a +1 to issues
they think are important, and URSSI will use these reactions as an element of prioritization. (ongoing)</p></li>
<li><p>Tracking completed activities and their consequences (ongoing)</p></li>
<li><p>Collecting examples of good and bad policy, structures, and interventions from industry and
from other disciplines (potential fellow project)</p></li>
<li><p>Developing an advocacy roadmap for how to effectively advocate (to universities, foundations,
industry, national labs) (policy person &amp; advisory committee, spread over 3 months)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, while this is a plan and not a proposal (it doesn’t have a budget envelope it is working to fit in,
it is not responding to a specific solicitation, and the potential funder’s goals are unclear) we have
considered priorities for these activities. Initial activities will mostly focus on research, as most advocacy
activities would follow and be based on the results and lessons of the research activities. In addition,
as mentioned above, final prioritization will also need inputs from the Policy Advisory Board and the URSSI
leadership team. Activities with a preceding “(+)” are considered higher priority than other activities.</p>

<p><strong>Faculty career path policy research activities</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Study tenure guidance and policies, and find/document ways that software work is measured
and recognized. Publish examples of successes.
(ADSA is interested in partnering on this; the ADSA Career Development Network is mostly faculty facing exactly these challenges.

as a collaborative platform to share both the intention and outcomes of pilots
and other initiatives that specifically address the academic reward system, as an outcome of the
European Union Open Source Policy Platform (OSPP) final report <span class="citation">(Mendez et al. <a href="references.html#ref-OSPP_report" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span>.) (2 months)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Faculty career path policy advocacy activities</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Promote best practices in recognizing and measuring software work in hiring practices and
tenure letters via sample guidance documents for committees, for faculty, and for
letter-of-reference authors. (needs focused workshop and follow-through, ~3 months over a year)</p></li>
<li><p>Commission a NAS report (similar to the one on <a href="https://www.nap.edu/read/25217/chapter/1">Open Source Software Policy Options for NASA
Earth and Space Sciences</a>) on career pathways/progression
in academia. Would need to define, then raise funds from
outside URSSI (~$1m), then work with NAS to define a charge and to contract for the study.
(4 months over 2.5 years, overlapping with related item in staff career path policy advocacy activities)</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Staff career path policy research activities</strong>:</p>
<p>(All the activities below will be coordinated with US-RSE and other national RSE organizations. Additionally, some information already exists that can be mined, such as international and national RSE surveys <span class="citation">(Philippe et al. <a href="references.html#ref-rse-survey" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a>)</span>, …)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>(+) Document existing (known successful/viable, known failures) career paths for individuals
creating research software (2 months)</p></li>
<li><p>(+) Examine and document industry career paths vs. national laboratory career paths vs. academic career paths (1 month)</p></li>
<li><p>(+) Create and maintain a mailing list for those interested in career paths (mailing list to be
supported by Community area) (ongoing, low level of effort)</p></li>
<li><p>Create a clearinghouse of job descriptions with criteria for performance assessment; distill
out design patterns or different categories for different roles. This could also include documenting
salary levels for different job descriptions, and connecting the job descriptions with then learning
modules necessary for these jobs (3-4 months, plus ongoing maintenance)</p></li>
<li><p>Examine how salaries for RSEs compare with those of other researchers? (needs to follow clearinghouse, 1 month)</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Staff career path policy advocacy activities</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>(+) Help start organizational “chapters” of research software developers (perhaps called URSSI chapters?) at existing
universities / societies / organizations; create handbook, tools, best practices to support
local organizers; assign an URSSI “coordinator” / community manager. These chapters could:
talk about training, do consulting for problems, host hacky hours, study groups, software days,
and come together in a larger event, perhaps a regional workshop or an URSSI-wide conference. Overall, this
helps / grows / establishes the community (and make connections that could help chapter members
meet the right person for their next career moves).</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Done with URSSI <a href="Ch-Comm.html#Ch-Comm">Community</a> area; Policy part (1 month) is creating some materials,
e.g., guidance on how to set up a chapter, how to align it to local activities, and how to run it.</p></li>
<li><p>Also to be coordinated with US-RSE, as regional US-RSE groups might overlap regional URSSI chapters.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Work to promote and support the establishment of RSE capabilities at universities around the US.
Provide advice on how to talk to university administrators (and which ones) about this, etc. (1 month,
jointly with US-RSE)</p></li>
<li><p>Provide examples of language to universities they can use in HR/job ads for RSE positions
(1 month, jointly with US-RSE)</p></li>
<li><p>Commission a NAS report (similar to the one on <a href="https://www.nap.edu/read/25217/chapter/1">Open Source Software Policy Options for NASA

</h4>
<p><strong>Incentivize contributions to public software policy research activities</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Gather data/examples that show when contributions to public projects increase your citation
count or regular metrics (1 month)</p></li>
<li><p>(+) Gather examples of successful use of individual contributions to public goods/infrastructure
to gain academic promotion (1 month over 3-6 months)</p></li>
<li><p>(+) Use regular surveys to better understand why people do and don’t contribute; get data to
understand the value of public goods to community (1 month over 3-6 months each year)</p></li>
<li><p>Determine a way to make it easy for scientific communities to peer-review public-good software
(or contributions to such software), with the idea that peer-review is considered a mark of
quality. This could be done by starting a new journal or working with existing journals or conferences,
or via existing community organizations or software-focused organizations (ongoing, not well-scoped)</p></li>
<li><p>Research to counter the idea that publishing in the small set of “highest impact” journals is
key, and expose actual impact of work instead (work with scholcom community, use what they have
done, maybe adapt their work for software - maybe 2 months to start)</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Incentivize contributions to public software policy advocacy activities</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Work to persuade high-profile individuals to make public contributions to public projects</p></li>
<li><p>(+) Share examples of successful use of individual contributions to public goods/infrastructure
to gain academic promotion, produce templates, advocacy toolkits and examples to help others
to make their case. Similarly, work to persuade people that contributing to projects will
increase their products within their normally accepted reward system (e.g., get more collaborators
and papers; increase opportunities to meet/work with new/old collaborators; will build social
connections/network) (ongoing, not well-scoped)</p></li>
<li><p>(+) Show how you can participate in public goods / infrastructure projects (e.g., how to
structure an issue, how to write your first PR), collaboratively with best practices activity in
URSSI <a href="Ch-Comm.html#Ch-Comm">Community</a> area (low initial effort, low ongoing effort to maintain)</p></li>
<li><p>Produce templates based on successful use of individual contributions to public
goods/infrastructure to gain academic promotion, advocacy toolkits, and examples to help
others to make their case (1 month)</p></li>
<li><p>Reframe contributions as first class research products / objects (i.e., explain how building
the best software is itself science, as it’s both discovery and creation). In order to do this,
amplify existing efforts to build a taxonomy of such contributions to make it clear what those
contributions are, and encourage people to claim/talk about/take pride in these contributions;
work with publishers to highlight these contributions and the people who make them. Also advocate
(materials, webinars, ambassadors, etc.) within academic communities (deans, faculty, science
societies, review panels, funders) that public software contributions are research (also could
be done by cross-disciplinary respected groups, such as the national academies)</p></li>
<li><p>(+) Work to revise funder policies to ensure reviewers prioritize grant proposals that reuse,
build-upon and contribute back to maintenance of public infrastructure</p></li>
<li><p>Create high-profile equivalent of “highest impact” journal for software and data work - where publication
is seen as an accomplishment indicating the significance of the software</p></li>

GCM model(s). How much money was invested in these projects and how did these projects return value to
the community? Examples of value could include: number of research projects taking advantage of these
solutions, amount saved by not having to reinvent these technologies. (6-to-12-month fellow project)</p></li>
<li><p>Quantify the money that has implicitly funded maintenance and sustainability, and has been saved
or lost in the shift to open source (e.g., where have funds been spent on one-off software rather

saved funds from being spent on one-off software) (6-month fellow project)</p></li>

<p><strong>Funding opportunities for software maintenance policy research activities</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>(+) Review the landscape of funding opportunities for software maintenance (and gather data about them)
and provide a public summary, then keep the summary up-to-date. (jointly done with ReSA? Or CZI EOSS?)
(1 month and some ongoing work)</p></li>
<li><p>Gather case studies of successful commercialization of open source projects and encourage the
research community to understand and make use of them (2 months)</p></li>
<li><p>Review the scope of maintenance needs by various research disciplines. Determine the order of
magnitude of the maintenance backlog for research software (with CHAOSS and others, unscoped)</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Funding opportunities for software maintenance policy advocacy activities</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Encourage funding agencies to require software management/maintenance plans (SMPs).
Use them to couple the idea of maintenance to the idea of development, to make it clear
that just doing development without maintenance doesn’t work. Note that this leads to
questions about when maintenance should be stopped, and it’s also unclear how long-term
maintenance would be supported (since grants are by definition time-limited).
(1-2 months/year ongoing, work with ReSA)</p></li>
<li><p>Advocate for funding agencies to provide a funding pool for short-term maintenance grants
for existing projects (e.g. CZI’s EOSS program). (1-2 months/year)</p></li>
<li><p>(+) Advocate for universities to support maintenance of software developed by their university
as part of research impact (or possibly technology transfer), in part by including how software
we highlight in the success stories campaign was paid for, including university and RSE contributions,
then using this collectively to demonstrate the impact of specific university-funded activities,
to encourage other universities to step up. (2 months/year over multiple years)</p></li>
<li><p>Encourage companies to provide funds and channel these funds into maintaining research
software projects, perhaps via a review process with reviewers from both academic software
projects and the companies. This could be done jointly with NumFOCUS or a similar organization,
similar to Tidelift (1-2 months/year)</p></li>

<li>
<p>Foster competition between universities (and their administrations), as has been done by
the SSI in the UK to create RSE groups, by:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Highlighting software work (including internal investments to sustain projects that the
university sees as important and prestigious) and successes (including funded projects that
focus on software) in some universities.</p></li>
<li><p>Ranking the contributions of universities to software or their structure for software developers,
and publicizing the ranking (maybe with US-RSE) – via newsletter, blogs, press releases
(pontentally run by or at least coordinated with the URSSI community area). This could be based in
part on information submitted by the software community, e.g. Laura Noren’s and Brad Stenger’s Data
Science Community Newsletter. These rankings and information would also be bi-directionally shared

e.g., ESA URSSI software award. The URSSI software contribution to research awards: URSSI/ESA
(e.g. John Chambers software award from stats association). $10k funding available from URSSI
(eventually domain societies would be asked to partially fund the awards). URSSI would need to
define the categories, criteria/heuristics, etc. for awards beforehand. And find people
(either staff or community volunteers) to run awards processes (accept nominations, make decisions)
(2 weeks/year starting in year 2)</p></li>
