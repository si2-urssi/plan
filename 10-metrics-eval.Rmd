# Metrics and Evaluation {#Ch-Metrics}

This chapter is being developed.

This table maps URSSI activities to the three portions of URSSI's intended impact. Activities are
preceded by a letter to indicate what area of URSSI they are from
(C = community and outreach,
E = education and training,
I = incubator,
P = policy), 
and in the impact cells, X indicates a designed primary impact on an activity, and y indicates
a designed secondary impact.
