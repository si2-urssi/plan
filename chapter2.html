<h1><span class="header-section-number">Chapter 2</span> URSSI Conceptualization</h1>
<p>The purpose of this conceptualization project was to create a roadmap for a US
Research Software Sustainability Institute (URSSI). The roadmap was to be
informed by and responsive to a community of potential stakeholders, including
researchers, software developers and users, funders, and program / product managers.
To engage this diverse group of people and institutions we completed the
research described in this section including a series of workshops, community outreach and
communication, a survey, set of ethnographic studies, and a pilot Winter School
for early-career researchers. At the conclusion of this section we offer a
summary of the challenges identified, collectively, across all of the URSSI
conceptualization activities and what role we believe URSSI should play in
addressing these challenges.</p>

<div id="workshops" class="section level2" number="2.1">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Workshops</h2>
<p><strong>Community wide workshops</strong>: In 2018 we held two community workshops with
URSSI stakeholders in Berkeley (April) and Chicago (October). We invited participants
based on their ability to represent diverse roles, institutions, and
perspectives on research software. The general goal of the two community workshops
was to determine which topics this diverse group of stakeholders consider to be
well-understood, which topics still have uncertainty or a need for guidance, and what work
remains to be done in supporting sustainable research software. URSSI PIs
facilitated broad discussions and participated in small group breakout
discussions. Additionally, participants at each workshop gave presentations
about their on-going research software activities.</p>
<p><strong>Thematic Workshops</strong>: Participants at the first community workshop identified
two topics worthy of more focused discussion and community input.
We organized the following workshops to better understand those topics:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The <strong>Metrics, Credit and Citation Workshop</strong>, held in Santa Barbara,
California in January 2019, focused on reseach software metrics, citation,
and impact evaluatin. The 23 participants had strong expertise in the
various workshop themes, including the PIs of the CodeMeta project, Zenodo,
and software credit initiatives such as SourceCred.</p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>Research Incubators Workshop</strong>, held in College Park, Maryland
in February 2019, focused on methods for incubating new and existing research projects.
The 20 participants had strong expertise in
research software project development, including program officers from
various government agencies, open-source research software developers,
and organizational scholars that have studied research software processes.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>URSSI Design Workshop</strong>: In April 2019 members of the Senior Personnel
and Advisory Committees participated in a workshop in Chicago, IL. PIs
presented preliminary results from our research (ethnographies and survey)
as well as lessons learned from the four previously held URSSI workshops.</p>
</div>
<div id="website-newsletter-blog" class="section level2" number="2.2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Website / Newsletter/ Blog</h2>
<p>One of the major goals of the conceptualization project was to build awareness
of the need for an institute, publicize our activities, and increase overall community interest.
To achieve this goal, we used a <a href="http://urssi.us">website</a>, nine <a href="http://urssi.us/newsletter/">newsletters</a>,
36 <a href="http://urssi.us/blog/">blog posts</a>, and a seires of public talks and webinars given
by the PIs and others. We sent the newsletters to the URSSI email list, which consists
of workshop attendees and other interested members of the community.
We also publicized the newsletter and blog posts via the <a href="https://twitter.com/si2urssi/">URSSI twitter account</a>,
which has over 500 followers.</p>
</div>
<div id="survey" class="section level2" number="2.3">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> Survey</h2>
<p>We developed and disseminated a survey to compliment workshop participation.
The primary goal of the survey was to gather the opinions, preferences, and
self-reported activities of the research software community regarding
development practices, development tools, training, funding/institutional
support, career paths, credit for software work, and diversity/inclusion.
For each of these topics, we asked a small number of general questions and
then allowed participants to self-select to answer more detailed questions
about any area of particular interest. We distributed the survey to PIs of
currently funded NSF and NIH projects and to relevant mailing lists. The
survey closed in May 2019 after receiving approximately 1200 responses.</p>
<p>The results of the survey highlighted some areas where URSSI could play a
key role in advancing the sustainability of research software in the United States.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>There was a mismatch between how respondents wanted to allocate their
time and their actual allocation of time. This result provides an opportunity
for URSSI to work with developers and teams to help them focus their efforts
on the tasks that are most relevant.</p></li>
<li><p>The aspects of the software development process respondents viewed as
being more difficult than they should be tended to be people-related
activities rather than technical activities. This result suggests that URSSI
could support teams and developers by providing training and/or
resources related to human factors in the software development process.</p></li>
<li><p>Respondents indicated they use a number of software development practices.
However, one key practice that was underutilized is peer code review. URSSI
can provide training on peer code review and work with teams to ensure that
the infrastructure is in place to appropriately support this activity in the
research software space.</p></li>
<li><p>The respondents indicated that software development practices including
<em>requirements</em>, <em>design</em>, <em>maintenance</em>, and <em>documentation</em> were not
well-supported by tools.</p></li>
<li><p>In terms of version control, there is still a sizable percentage of
people who use methods like <em>copying files to another location</em> and
<em>zip file backups</em> as version control. This result suggests that URSSI
could provide additional training and tools to help teams use modern
version control systems.</p></li>
<li><p>Many of the items above relate to training, or the lack thereof. The
survey results suggest a large percentage of respondents have not received
training in software development. While the respondents indicated there were
sufficient opportunities for training, most of them suggested they did not
have sufficient time for training. URSSI could help by providing training
in different formats that work better with the demands of the research
software developers’ environments.</p></li>
<li><p>Many respondents also found the level of support, in terms of funding,
to be inadequate to be successful. URSSI could help by advocating both at
the national funding level as well as at the University level for increased
funding for important research software development activities.</p></li>
<li><p>Respondents also indicated their software contributions were not
significantly valued in performance reviews. URSSI could help by developing
and advocating for policies that help research software developers get
adequate recognition for their work.</p></li>
<li><p>Most projects lack a formal diversity plan. URSSI could help by providing
template diversity plans and support for developing
appropriate plans for individual projects.</p></li>

<div id="ethnography" class="section level2" number="2.4">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.4</span> Ethnography</h2>
<p>To gain a deeper understanding of the practices and experiences of researchers
who are actively engaged in software development, we have undertaken a series of
ethnographic studies. These studies focused on software projects of varying
size and complexity in the fields of hydrology, astronomy, and biochemistry.
Using observations, semi-structured interviews, and a
series of archival documents, we produced case studies of how, over time, these
projects overcame challenges of recruiting contributors, building a governance
model, seeking funding, and sharing credit in sustaining a software project that
has demonstrable impact on a community of researchers.</p>
<p>We developed two of these studies, Astropy and Rosetta Commons, as full case
studies. Both projects face unique sustainability challenges that they solved
somewhat differently. While the main findings of this work are not novel
in the sense that they will surprise anyone familiar with challenges to sustaining
research software, the value of this work is in comparing the two cases. By better
understanding common approaches to overcoming sustainability challenges, we believe
there is a valuable opportunity to abstract these approaches into models of success
that research software projects in other domains can modify or tailor.
The following is a brief summary of the findings from these two case studies.</p>
<p>Points of comparison:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Distributed work coordination</em>: Key to the success of both Astropy and Rosetta
Commons is coordination of remote collaborative work. Astropy mirrors Python’s
core development team in structuring contributor guidelines and supporting
designated maintainers. Rosetta Commons differs substantially in that the project
employs four full-time infrastructure maintainers. This offloading of
maintenance responsibilities frees up contributors (distributed labs throughout
the USA) to focus on conducting research and driving innovations that extend
Rosetta’s key functionality.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Funding</em>: Astropy is fiscally sponsored by NumFocus, but depends upon grant
funding from a variety of sources to sustain its collective work. A recent
grant from Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, “Sustaining and Growing the
Astropy Project,” is focused exclusively on maintenance and governance for
the project’s long-term viability to practicing astronomers. Rosetta Commons
combines licensing and grant funding to sustain its work. Licenses for
commercial use and an NIH infrastructure maintenance grant have continuously
supported the project since 2005.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Credit</em>: Both projects have had a number of papers published about their
development. Astropy suggests two publications to cite when acknowledging
use of the software <span class="citation">(Robitaille et al. <a href="#ref-robitaille2013astropy" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a>; Price-Whelan et al. <a href="#ref-price2018astropy" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span>. These two
publications, combined, have over 3000 citations. Rosetta Commons,
because it has many versions, methods, and language specific implementations,
has no canonical citation. Interviews with contributors to Rosetta noted
that this lack of canonical citation causes confusion for authors when rushing towards publication.
Many researchers have sought a centralized source they could acknowledge.
Despite the lack of a canonical citation, two papers describing Rosetta and
its use in predicting protein structures have, combined, over 4300
citations <span class="citation">(Rohl et al. <a href="#ref-rohl2004protein" role="doc-biblioref">2004</a>; Salmena et al. <a href="#ref-salmena2011cerna" role="doc-biblioref">2011</a>)</span>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We observe differences in the two projects that seem marginal at first
glance, but upon further analysis have important practical consequences
for software development activities. For example, two substantial
differences in the projects have consequences for the long-term sustainability
of each project:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Astropy, in following an open model of contribution, focuses time and
attention on clearly documenting and making contributor guidelines
accessible to research software engineers. The maintenance team
therefore focuses their effort on ensuring contributors are supported
while simultaneously keeping various packages up to date and available
to the community that depends upon this code for their research. This approach is
partially a result of the software ecosystem being broadly useful to a
discipline (Astronomy), as compared to Rosetta Commons, which focused on
specific analytic tasks within a subfield of biological engineering
(Macromolecular modelling).</p></li>
<li><p>Continuous annual grant funding and licensing fees allow Rosetta to
centralize infrastructure tasks to a core team whose sole job is
maintenance. This approach in turn encourages innovation and expansion of feature
sets for labs that focus solely on producing new research insights.
Astropy has, over time, centralized maintenance of the project’s software
development and maintenance. But until very recently, this maintenance has been a
volunteer activity. Shifting time, attention, and energy towards organizing
an open-source model of development impacts career trajectories for
practicing astronomers and contributes to a more fragile ecosystem for astronomy.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We recognize that software sustainability is more than just financial support,
but what these case studies make clear is that the economic realities of
maintaining and contributing to software development have important downstream
impacts that shape innovation and engagement. The URSSI conceptualization
has studied how these challenges can be practically overcome.</p>
</div>
<div id="chapter2-WinterSchool" class="section level2" number="2.5">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.5</span> Winter School</h2>
<p>In late December 2019 we ran our
first ever URSSI school on research software engineering. We began accepting
applications in July and received an overwhelming response to our call for
applications. For the 30 participant slots available, we received 169
applications, meaning we had a challenging time selecting the participants
and had to turn away a large number of interested researchers. While the
selection committee used multiple criteria to evaluate and select participants,
successful applicants already had some experience with Python programming, Git,
and Unix skills, which was necessary to benefit from the workshop. Our goal
was not to repeat the same material covered in bootcamps and Software Carpentry
style workshops, but to focus on the research software engineering skills that
not formally taught in any setting. These skills include best practices
for packaging code as software, testing, collaborative software development,
code review, and related topics such as licensing and archiving. The school
lasted 2.5 days.</p>
<p>Based on the demand described above, this experience made evident the strong
need for the skills covered in the school. The overall feedback from the
school was also positive (more on that below). Some key lessons from this
pilot that impact our design of a Summer School as part of URSSI are: 1) the
school needs to be longer to allow for both discussion time and focused time
for students to work on their own code, applying the lessons from the lectures;
and 2) the presence of additional helpers outside of the primary instructors was
quite beneficial to help answer specific questions from the students.</p>
<p>A few example quotes from the Winter School feedback form include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>“I really can’t say enough good things about this super empowering workshop!
You did an amazing job identifying the things I didn’t know that I didn’t know,
and teaching them at a level that was immediately actionable in my work.”</p></li>
<li><p>“Thank you so much to everyone for taking this amazing initiative to teach young
scientists on software sustainability.”</p></li>
<li><p>“Thank you for putting together this winter-school, it was super useful to me
and I’m looking forward to applying everything I learned to my future projects
and to go deeper into the topics that were covered.”</p></li>

<div id="research-software-engineering-rse" class="section level3" number="2.6.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.6.2</span> Research Software Engineering (RSE)</h3>
<p>In a 2012 workshop run by the UK SSI, a number of UK researchers who develop
software realized that while they internally recognized a number of common elements
to the work they did, along with others at their universities, there was no
commonality to how others saw this work and these roles, and they needed to come
together to build and develop a community. As stated by James Hetheringon, they
decided they needed to “develop the profession of a scientific software engineer
and the career track of software developers in academia.” The SSI studied academic job
descriptions in the UK, and found about 10000, of which about 400 were related to
software development, with 194 different job titles. To build recognition of the
common software elements of these positions, the SSI chose the name “research software
engineer”. The SSI then began publicizing this idea, building a community of people who
identified with the role, leading to the formation of the UK RSE Association, which is
now the <a href="https://society-rse.org">Society of Research Software Engineering</a>.
The SSI and RSE Association/Society encouraged people who were performing RSE-like work
to also identify with this title,
built RSE groups in UK universities, encouraged universities to change their
job titles, held workshops and then conferences for RSEs, encouraged a funding
agency to provide fellowships to RSEs, and built up the association/society,
which now has about 2000 members <span class="citation">(Hettrick <a href="#ref-RSEHettrick" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>As a number of non-UK people (including some URSSI PIs) started attending UK RSE
conferences, the SSI also supported activities to grow the international community.
These self-developed and SSI-supported activities have led to RSE groups in Germany,
the Netherlands, the Nordic countries, the US, Canada, Australia/New Zealand, South Africa, and Belgium, some of
which have now held national workshops and conferences. The US Research Software
Engineer Association (US-RSE) formed in 2018, with the support and participation
of three of the five URSSI PIs, and has 420 members as of May 2020. The US-RSE
Association is centered around three main goals:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Community</em>: to provide a coherent association of those who identify with the role
(not necessarily title) of Research Software Engineer, and to provide the members
of the community the ability to share knowledge, professional connections, and resources.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Advocacy</em>: to promote RSEs’ impact on research, highlighting the increasingly
critical and valuable role RSEs serve.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Resources</em>: to provide useful resources to multiple demographics, including technical
and career development resources, and information and material to support the
establishment and expansion of RSE positions and groups within the research ecosystem.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>There are thus some overlaps between US-RSE’s goals and URSSI’s and a clear reason
for us to work together going forward.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="synthesis-of-urssi-activities" class="section level2" number="2.7">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.7</span> Synthesis of URSSI Activities</h2>
<p>In the following section we describe common challenges and dilemmas we
identified across URSSI’s conceptualization activities. Where possible, we identify
the role URSSI could play in helping overcome these challenges as a funded institute.</p>
<p><strong>Challenge 1: Decentralized expertise</strong></p>
<p>Throughout the planning activities, the community of stakeholders recognized
that there already exist a number of individual efforts to help improve the
development, maintenance, and overall sustainability of research software in
the US. While these efforts, collectively, are comprehensive in their scope,
the decentralized structure of this expertise is inefficient for both resource
discovery and delivery of services. For example there are many points of expertise
in research software development (e.g., SWEBOK, RSEs), education and training
(e.g., academic initiatives, Carpentries), credit and metrics (e.g., CiteAs),
incubation (e.g., ESIP, the UW eScience Institute) that are available to
individuals at specific institutions. However, there is currently no comprehensive
organization that can serve to coordinate these activities, promote centers of
expertise, and ensure that effort is not duplicated– a role that is played
admirably in the UK by the Software Sustainability Institute.</p>
<p>As a coordinating center, URSSI could help solve this challenge in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Broker connections between points of expertise and serve to coordinate
efforts and funding such that different experts could better collaborate on
sustainable development, education, and policy initiatives.</p></li>
<li><p>Identify and convene experts to help fill gaps that exist between service
delivery, for example, where the Carpentries see gaps in knowledge skill or
acquisition in sustaining software education.</p></li>
<li><p>Disseminate best practices from specific disciplines to the broader
research community. By acting as a center of research software excellence
URSSI could be a space where solutions from one domain could be learned and
efficiently transferred to another.</p></li>
<li><p>Coordinate and help to curate relevant research software packages through
discovery portals, such as <a href="https://libraries.io/" class="uri">https://libraries.io/</a></p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Challenge 2: Pathways to sustainability for non-commercial research software</strong></p>
<p>Throughout the URSSI conceptualization activities, participants voiced concern
for the viability of valuable software projects that do not seek
commercialization. Technology transfer programs at universities and through
research funding agencies (e.g. I-Corps, SBIR/STTR) are well established
and have been successful at helping entrepreneurially-focused software projects
recognize and execute viable business models. This transition pathway is
promoted for software that has a potential to sustain itself through fees or
licensing agreements. However, there is no equivalent university guidance for
software projects that would like to pursue non-commercial open source models
for sustainability.</p>
<p>There is a need for a US-based institute, divorced from any single university,
to help valuable research software projects realize a non-commercial
open-source route to sustainability. This support could include a program, such as an
incubator, that would guide research software projects towards developing
open-source governance, budgeting, licensing, and fiscal sponsorship in service
of non-commercial sustainability. We view this route, and its guidance from an
institute, as critical to promoting an ecosystem of diverse research software
projects that may not be readily amenable to commercialization, or have the
potential to build healthy and viable volunteer developer communities as an
alternative to licensing.</p>
<p><strong>Challenge 3: Coordinated advocacy and analysis for policy change</strong></p>
<p>Related to the first challenge of decentralized expertise, there is a need
for coordination and targeted leadership around policy for sustainable
research software. Participants in URSSI workshops described a need for
coordinating communities around emerging national, institutional, and even
disciplinary specific policies that have a downstream impact on sustainability,
such as software citation principles, tenure and promotion guidelines that
recognize research software contributions, sustained funding or financial
support for research software maintenance, and software management plans
that explicitly document expectations around software development and archiving.</p>
<p>Currently, community members take on many of these policy activities as additional
professional service, or as volunteer work. This secondary focus on any
one policy issue, in turn, leads to slow progress, high turnover of volunteers,
and does not allow any one person or institution to develop the deep expertise
needed for effective sustained analysis or advocacy.</p>
<p>An institute that could dedicate time and attention to policy design, invest
personnel time in developing needed expertise, and coordinate a sustainable
lobbying network would allow advocacy work to become more manageable,
effective, and result in better outcomes for research software stakeholders.
Further, there is often a need to conduct advocacy work driven by
empirical research that can substantiate how or why one policy decision is
better than another. An institute dedicated to these activities would
facilitate data-driven policy research that could lead to stronger advocacy
positions, and benefit funding agencies, universities, and research
institutions that seek to adopt new policy aimed at improving research
software sustainability.</p>
<p><strong>Challenge 4: Signals of viability</strong></p>
<p>A valuable contribution of the URSSI workshop and engagement activities has
been convening stakeholders with expertise in the evaluation and funding of
research software. These stakeholders include current and former program officers
from NSF, NIH, DoE, DoD, and IMLS, as well as philanthropic organizations
like the Gordon and Betty Moore and Alfred P. Sloan foundations. These
participants have a collective desire for an institute to develop stronger
signals of a research software project’s viability; to help evaluate a
project’s potential for long-term sustainability; and help communities of
research software stakeholders coalesce around strategic funding initiatives
that could benefit research through software investments.</p>
<p>A dedicated US institute focused on software sustainability could help meet
this challenge in a number of ways, but we recognize that there is no
overarching or simple solution. The plan we describe below explains,
in numerous places, how URSSI can and should convene different communities
to address complex problems like strategic financial investment, evaluation
for viability, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Challenge 5: Career Advancement and Credit</strong></p>
<p>Closely related to Challenges 1, 3 and 4 is a desire of URSSI stakeholders to
see an institute dedicate time and resources towards promoting recognition
for research software activities and helping to shape reliable career pathways
for research software engineers (RSEs). At URSSI workshops, there was
near-unanimous agreement that the acknowledgement of research software
contributions remains difficult for career advancement and there is a lack
of clear guidance for both universities and funding agencies on how to make
progress on these issues.</p>
<p>A dedicated US-based institute for research software sustainability could
play a leading role in advocating for best practices in the measurement,
reward, and credit for research software activities. This activity would include
dedicated research into measuring and evaluating software development activities,
advancing techniques for use and user impact evaluation, and promoting formative
metrics that are conducive to long-term viability. Relatedly, a dedicated US-based
institute could better evaluate and promote the impact of research software
engineering positions that currently exist and advocate for their creation
where they do not.</p>
<p>In the next chapter, we describe URSSI’s plan to meet each of these challenges.
In particular, we focus on how a strategic investment in a US-based software
sustainability institute would practically organize itself, allocate budgets,
and measure progress on each of the challenges identified in the conceptualization phase.</p>
